## Windows 10 Patch Tuesday

This last
[Windows path](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/microsoft-patch-tuesday-november-2021-edition/)
fixed 6 zero day vulnerabilities, including:

1. Microsoft excel security feature bypass vulnerability
	- Allows a hacker to execute code and bypass security when you open a booby trapped excel file
2. Microsoft exchange server remote code execution vulnerability
	- Allows a hacker to execute code over a network on a MS exchange server
3. Remote Desktop Protocol information disclosure vulnerability
	- Allows a hacker to extract RDP passwords when working local
4. Another Remote Desktop Protocol information disclosure vulnerability
	- Allows a hacker to extract RDP passwords when working local
5. Another another Remote Desktop Client remote code execution vulnerability
	- Allows a hacker to execute remote code on a client when they connect to a compromised server

Thankfully, none of these effect regular, consumer users, but these are a threat to enterprise users and Win sysadmins (poor poor Win sysadmins).
